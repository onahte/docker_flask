## Summary

The goal of this project was to become familiar with technologies and tools used in website implementation. The website was built using Bootstrap, Flask and some Javascript, which was then containerized by Docker and served from Heroku. The spin-up of the website was automated using Git actions and workflows.

Testing was also incorporated with Pylint and Pytest, where the website is tested for proper site deployment every time code is pushed or pulled to/from the main branch.

As a coding exercise and to become familiar with OOP, a rudimentary calculator app was built and is included in this repo as are the tests to validate its arithmetic functions. The calculator tests are also run with every push/pull to the main branch. The calculator is not accessible from the deployed website as it was just a learning tool. The website incorporates discussion of the calculator app.
